                    <p class="description">I'm the middle child in a family of all girls, and from a young age, I learned the value of hard work. At just 12, I started working to help support my family. While I had to put my education on hold for a year before college due to financial challenges, I was determined to continue learning. My family comes first, My father is half body stroke that makes it difficult for him to find a blue collar job but my father dedication to provide he decided to help and provide despite of his condition by collecting valuable garbage that can trade to money, and my mother tirelessly running her balut stall has instilled in me a deep sense of resilience and dedication. My sisters and I are all driven students, achieving academic success with flying colors. We may face challenges, but we are a strong and supportive family, always striving to reach our goals together.</p>

                    <p class="description">My favorites are a reflection of my personality and what brings me joy. When it comes to food, I can't resist Kare-Kare. For a refreshing drink, I always reach for soda because its refreshing and I know its bad for my health but I just can't resist. My favorite color is pink . And when it comes to movies, I'm a big fan of Korean Drama because it make me feel so calm and also happy.</p>

                    <p> This is my Senior High School Graduation in Valenzuela, but we reside in North Caloocan. One of the most cherished core memories involves my father attending my graduation because it was always just my Mother. It was a momentous occasions, made even more special by the fact that he had to travel a significant distance to be there.</p>

It's funny how our friendship blossomed because of a common misconception that I was "rude/intimidating."</p>

                    <p>The SHS graduation ceremony marked a significant milestone, a testament to my resilience.  I navigated the daily grind of a three-hour commute, all while maintaining my "With Honor" status in Grades 11 and 12.  Balancing school with a fast-food job to support my studies and family was no easy feat, but I persevered.  This achievement is a reflection of my dedication and determination.</p>

It became my source of income for the whole month and I manage to pay for my graduation fee and I'm so proud and thankful to the people around me that help me during this time.</p>

He's also made my studies more bearable, often sharing his "baon" with me when he knows I'm running low on money. His unwavering support has made all the difference, and I'm so grateful for him.
